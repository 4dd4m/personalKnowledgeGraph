Child-routes are a good solution to avoid url-pattern repetition. `children` takes an array of routes:

```vue
const router = createRouter({
    history:  createWebHistory(),
    routes: [
        {path: '/', component: TeamsList, alias : '/'},

        {path: '/teams', component: TeamsList, children: [ // <--- <route-vew> goes here in the component
            {path: '/:teamId', component: TeamMembers},    // <--- child-route itself
        ]},

        {path: '/users', component: UsersList, props: true},
        {path: '/:notFound(.*)', component: TeamMembers},
    ],
});
```

The `/teams` is already defined in the routes, so we drop it in a children. Child-routes cannot be called like the top level routes (`/`,`/users`,`/:notFound(.*)`).

## Rendering child routes

So the child routes are used to render a view-in-a-view. Let's register the child-route `route-view` tag in the component:

```vue
//TeamsList.vue
<template>
    <router-view></router-view>                         //<--- registered for the child-route
  <ul>
    <teams-item
      v-for="team in teams"
      :key="team.id"
      :name="team.name"
      :member-count="team.members.length"
      :team-id="team.id"
    ></teams-item>
  </ul>
</template>
```
 
So the child route will be rendered in the parent dynamically. BUT! the child route cannot be called from the top-most level, on it's own.


TODO: insert a working project here

In this project, if click on the view buttons, the top part of the navbar remains highlighted (because we never leave the current url). The child-route will be inserted (in this case) above the parent template. Important! We stayed on the same page, so the navbar is still active. Furthermore, if we click any of the view buttons, the child-routes just simply re-renders. Nicely.
