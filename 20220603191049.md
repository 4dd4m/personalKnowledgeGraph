We can write a ton of v-ifs in our app just to render something small. This is totally fine is we have 1-2 component. But what if we have more than a 100 component? Consider the beginner way:

```vue
//template description
<template>
    <div>
        <TheHeader />
        <button @click="setSelectedComponent('ActiveGoals')">ActiveGoals</button>
        <button @click="setSelectedComponent('ManageGoals')">ManageGoals</button>
        
        <user-info  v-if="selectedComponent === 'selected'"></user-info> 
        <user-info2 v-if="selectedComponent === 'selected'"></user-info2> 
        <user-info3 v-if="selectedComponent === 'selected'"></user-info3> 
        <user-info4 v-if="selectedComponent === 'selected'"></user-info4> 
        <user-info5 v-if="selectedComponent === 'selected'"></user-info5> 
    </div>
</template>

//app part
    methods:{
        setSelectedComponent(cmp){
            this.selectedComponent = cmp;
        }
    }
```

So we have here 5 components, which is controlled with one value. We can render them dynamically with the `component` Vue built-in tag.

```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <TheHeader />
        <button @click="setSelectedComponent('ActiveGoals')">ActiveGoals</button>
        <button @click="setSelectedComponent('ManageGoals')">ManageGoals</button>
        <keep-alive>
            <component :is="selectedComponent"></component> 
        </keep-alive>
    </div>
</template>
```

So what's the `keep-alive` for? When Vue switching between these context, it will remove it from the DOM. So for instance if we have some dynamic content in the template what we want to keep (a form input value and the user entered something already), that will be removed. The `keep-alive` tag will keep the element in the DOM, so value of the input field is retained.
