# Hosting multiple sites with docker containers

Why is this awesome?

Because all subdomain have their own server instance. They can even have separated db instance (or a global one). That makes them portable. With a script the container creation can be automated. This way we can host heavy frameworks i.e. wordpress, wikipedia, laravel, webclient for email etc., and the same time keep the codebase clean from other instances.

What we need to achieve is hosting separated nginx instances/subdomain:
* myvirtualmachine.com (virtual host at 192.168.0.16)
* adam.myvirtualmachine.com
* keelan.myvirtualmachine.com
* first.myvirtualmachine.com


Some requirements:
* The **proxy container should start first** (this is achieved by adding the`depends_on` tag to the sub-images).
* Every container **should expose** a `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `VIRTUAL_PORT` setting (that's how the proxy knows where to route the traffic).
* If we run this on a local internal network, we need to set up the DNS adresses in the `/etc/hosts` file, since our computer doesnt know this address:

```bash
192.168.0.16 myvirtualmachine.com
192.168.0.16 first.myvirtualmachine.com
192.168.0.16 adam.myvirtualmachine.com
192.168.0.16 keelan.myvirtualmachine.com
```

We need to use the nginx-proxy image (this is responsible for routing the traffic).


```yml
version: '3.9'
services:
    proxy:
        image: nginxproxy/nginx-proxy
        container_name: proxy
        ports:
        - 80:80
        volumes:
        - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock
        - /home/adam/web/default:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
```

Example "end-nginx" container:
```yml
adam:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: adam
    depends_on:
    - proxy
    expose:
    - 80
    environment:
    - VIRTUAL_HOST=adam.myvirtualmachine.com
    - VIRTUAL_PORT=80
    volumes:
    - /home/adam/web/adam:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
```

For the complete configuration open this file: [proxy.yml](src/docker-subdomain/proxy.yml)

Finally start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose -f proxy.yml up -d
```
where is:
* `-f` calls the *.yml file
* `-d` starting the containers as a daemon (detached) mode
