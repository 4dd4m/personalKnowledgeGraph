summary: Getting the reference just like in vanilla JS
---
We can consider the ref as a "reference". Like in vanilla javascript. `@input`, `@keydown` etc. directives are constantly watching the changes and this is not economic. With the `ref=""` directive, Vue will de-reference the value once at runtime:

```html
<input ref="input">
```

Referencing in the app:

```vue
this.$refs.input.value;
```
