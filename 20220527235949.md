# vue ref command

We can consider the ref as a "reference". Like in vanilla javascript. `@input`, `@keydown` etc. directives are constantly watching the changes and this is not economic. With the `ref=""` directive, Vue will de-reference the value once at runtime:

    <input ref="input">
    

Referencing in the app:

    this.$refs.input.value;
    
    Tags:
        #vue-ref
