summary: How to communicate back?
---
In order to communicate back we need to create a method in the child component (`submitData()`). A possible form `@click` event will call this method. The `submitData()` method will grab the form data (usually through `refs`). The next step is to make a callback to the parent component (`this.addResource()`), but in order to use this, we need to record this method in the inject property that is how Vue knows it is a callback so it will pass this call to parent:

```vue
//child component
export default {
    inject: ['addResource'],
    data(){return {}},
    methods:{
        submitData(){
            const eneteredTitle = this.$refs.titleInput.value;
            const eneteredDesc = this.$refs.descInput.value;
            const eneteredLink = this.$refs.linkInput.value;

            this.addResource(eneteredTitle, eneteredDesc,eneteredLink);
        }
    }
}
```

In the parent component the `addResource()` is obviously defined in the methods, and here the `provide()` property will bind the callback function to it's local method (`addResource: this.addResource`):

```vue
//parent component
methods:{
    setSelectedTab(tab){
        this.selectedTab = tab;
    },
    addResource(title, desc, url){
        const newResource = {
            id : new Date().toString(),
            title: title,
            description: desc,
            link: url,
        }
        this.storedResources.unshift(newResource);
        this.selectedTab = 'storedResources';
    }
},
provide(){
    return{
        resources: this.storedResources,
        addResource: this.addResource,
    }
},
```

From this point the `methods.addResource()` just does the job with the data.
