**Computed Properties**:
* Its value cached (kept)
* Vue will recalculate their value only if they are changed (dependency changed)
* always called without `()`
* main use for keeping the derived value
* absolutely no logic appears in the template (abstracted in the property method)

**Method properties**:
* Vue recalculates it on every render (every single time), because there is not aware about them
* always called with `()`
* may be some logic in the template

Both:
* having `data` property and `method` property at the same time gives a **warning**
* having `data` property and `computed` property at the same time gives a **warning**
* having `method` property and `computed` property at the same time runs the computed property

These are not errors, but affects the functionality, mainly the performance.

## IMPORTANT CONCEPT!

**Whenever a value change, `method` properties are run every time!** However, this is not visible...

```javascript
methods:{
    add(){
        return this.counter++;
    },
    remove(){
        return this.counter--;
    },
    printName(event){
        this.name = event.target.value;
    },
    reset(){
        this.counter = 0;
        this.name = "";
    }
},
computed:{
    propertyN(){

    }
}
```


The Solution is to use `computed` properties which they change only if the used value inside of'em changes.
