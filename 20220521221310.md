# Docker - HEALTCHECK

The  `HEALTHCHECK` instruction tells Docker how to test a container to **check that it is still working**. This can detect cases such as a web server that is stuck in an infinite loop and unable to handle new connections, even though the server process is still running.

When a container has a healthcheck specified, it has a health status in addition to its normal status. This status is initially starting. Whenever a health check passes, it becomes healthy (whatever state it was previously in). After a certain number of consecutive failures, it becomes unhealthy.

```bash
FROM nginx:1.13-alpine
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --retries=2 \
CMD nc -vz -w 2 localhost 80 || exit 1
```

* Or as a runtime command. Defining a health check at runtime overrides the health check defined in the image if one exists. 

```bash
docker container run --name=healthcheck_ex -d \
--health-cmd='nc -vz -w 2 localhost 80 || exit 1' \
nginx:1.13-alpine
```
