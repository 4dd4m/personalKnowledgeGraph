# Difference Between Processes and Threads

## Process

Process is a running program, scheduled in the CPU for execution. Process Control Block describes the 
concept (content) of the process. Processes can start Child Processes. They do **isolate**.

States of the Process:
* new
* ready
* running
* waiting
* terminated
* suspended

**There is no `blocked` process exist!**

## Thread

Segment of the process

States of Threads:
* Ready
* Running
* Blocked

Takes less time to terminate a thread. They Do not isolate! (Adress space is shared with other threads)
