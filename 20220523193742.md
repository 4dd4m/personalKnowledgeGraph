The ternary operator is a form of syntactic sugar for an in-line if/else statement. Many languages natively support the operator. Bash does not have a native ternary operator.

## General forms

String equals to something:
```bash
alpha=a
[[ "$alpha" == "a" ]] && echo "a is a" || echo "a is not a"
```

String is Empty:
```bash
alpha=a
[ -n "$alpha" ] && echo "a is a" || echo "a is not a"
```

The idea behind this is the condition evaluates to `0`. The right side of the `&&` is also evaluates to `0` (no news means good news) which is just a pure `echo command`. If the conditional evaluates to false (**exit code** `1`), the operation on the right side (`||`) will be executed.
