summary: How to generate docker images?
---
In general (manual way):
* run the container in bash
* make changes and exit
* commit the images as a new name

If the images has been built from a script (Dockerfile), we can still make changes to the container, committing it yields the same result.

```bash
docker container run --name hw_container \
ubuntu:latest \
touch /HelloWorld
docker container commit hw_container hw_image

docker container rm -vf hw_container
docker container run --rm \
hw_image \
ls -l /HelloWorld
```
