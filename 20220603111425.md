summary: Items cannot be wrapped in a traditional way by the nature of Vue, despite it has some nice solution.

Slots are used to warp around elements which holds a content. Slots mainly registered in the `main.js` file, what makes it available to the entire project. Two types exists: named and unnamed slots. First, wee need to register the component in the classical way: 

```vue
//main.js
//component registration
import BaseCard from './components/BaseCard.vue';

app.component('base-card', BaseCard);
```

And we can use the `base-card` tag in the template. To use it in a component, we just need to wrap the content what we want to be wrapped:

```vue
//someComponent.js
<template>
    <section>
        <base-card>
        <div>
            <h3>{{ fullName }}</h3>
            <base-badge :type="role" :caption="role.toUpperCase()"></base-badge>
        </div>
            <p>{{ infoText }}</p>
        </base-card>
        </section>
</template>
```
The slot has a special tag `<slot>`:
```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <slot></slot>
    </div>
</template>
```

Everything between the `<teamplate>` and the `<slot>` element will be wrapped around the content. In vanilla javascript (considering only the mechanism), the solution would be something like this:

```javascript
// parent component passing slot content
FancyButton('Click me!')

// FancyButton renders slot content in its own template
function FancyButton(slotContent) {
  return (
    `<button class="fancy-btn">
      ${slotContent}
    </button>`
  )
}
```

### Named Slots

However, there is some situation when we organize our templates that we need to use multiple slots. The problem arise if you use two slot, because we wont know which is for which. To name a tag we have to add the `name=""` attribute to the tag. The template still can contain one, and only one unnamed slot. This will be considered as the **default** slot (`slot` tag is used in the slot declaration, in the template we refer to it as a `template`). `<template>` is a generic HTML element, it does nothing:

```vue
//slot wrapper
<template>
    <div><slot name="header"></slot></div>
    <div><slot></slot></div>
    <div><slot name="footer"></slot></div>
</template>
```

And here we use to slots in the template. All the information what we want to put in the slot, we need to wrap between `<template></template>` tags. The `v-slot:header` syntax is very "sensitive", it define where to content goes:

```vue
//someComponent.js
<template>
    <section>
        <base-card>
        <template v-slot:header>
            <div>
                <h3>{{ fullName }}</h3>
                <base-badge :type="role" :caption="role.toUpperCase()"></base-badge>
            </div>
        </template>

        <template v-slot:default>
        <p>{{ infoText }}</p>
        </template>

        </base-card>
    </section>
</template>
```

Shorthand: `v-slot:header === #header`

The (inner)`<template>` tags referring to the `<base-card>`'s template. **Named slots must use `<template>`!**

There is no explicit connection between the template file and the component file, the template file imported globally, so it is somewhat hard to spot.

### Styling

Scoped only affect on the template static elements. In the code above if we define a scoped style in the `someComponent.js` file, we will have no access to the template tags, because they were forwarded to the next component. (The only valid style-able element is the section).

### Default value of a slot

At the slot definition, if we put something between the `slot` tags, that will render as a default value (if there was nothing pass to it):

```vue
//slot wrapper
<template>
    <div><slot name="header">This is a default header</slot></div>
    <div><slot></slot></div>
    <div><slot name="footer"></slot></div>
</template>
```

The `This is a default header` will only render if there was nothing passed to the `header` slot.
