## V-model modifiers
`v-model` will keep the input's type, but if we really want, we can force it like this by using [modifiers](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/forms.html#modifiers):

```vue
v-model.number=""
```

Some built-in modifiers are:
* .lazy (controls the frequency of the polls)
* .number (convert the input to a number)
* .trim (remove excess white space)

## Getting a value of a select element
`v-model` works as expected, always returns with the selected item, the default can be set by setting a property in the `data()` prop. to one of the selected's element value.

## Getting a value of a checkbox & radio element
In this case the `v-model` gives back an array.

```vue
//the form
<div class="form-control">
  <h2>What are you interested in?</h2>
  <div>
    <input id="interest-news" name="interest" value="news" type="checkbox" v-model="interest" />
    <label for="interest-news">News</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="interest-tutorials" name="interest" value="tutorials" type="checkbox" v-model="interest"/>
    <label for="interest-tutorials">Tutorials</label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <input id="interest-nothing" name="interest" value="nothing" type="checkbox" v-model="interest"/>
    <label for="interest-nothing">Nothing</label>
  </div>
</div>
```

However this is not enough. If in this state we select all element for example and we unselecting it, all selections will disappear. Vue doesn't know how tho handle the elements. a `value=""` should be added to the input element (we would do that in any other framework to process the data).

```vue
//corresponding data prop
data(){
    return{
        userName: '',
        age: null,
        referrer: 'newspaper',
        interest: [],
        how: null,
    }
},
```
