summary:
---
With Options API, we can use the watch option to trigger a function whenever a reactive property changes.

* watcher binds to computed properties or to data properties (with the same name)
* when the corresponding value changes, the watcher executes
* doesnt return anything because it doesnt need to
* the watcher function automatically gets the latest value of the watched item
* contains logic
* "execute code if something changed"

Watch is shallow by default.
