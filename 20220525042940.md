# Git delete commits and reset head

Resetting the HEAD, throwing away the commits:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~5                 #delete back 5 commit
```

or

```bash
git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>       #delete back to this commit
```


These changes are only local! So to apply it run:

```bash
git push origin HEAD --force
```
