## Usage of v-ifs

Conditionally renders the element if the condition is true.


```html{}
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">...</p>
```
The condition can be anything, computed property or anything what returns or evaluates to a true `false` `state`. Condition can be combined (`&&`, `||`).

However this seems invalid but still valid (in the DOM the elements comes right after):


```html
<section id="user-goals">
<h2>My course goals</h2>
<input type="text" v-model="enteredGoal" />
<button @click="getGoal">Add Goal</button>
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!</p>
<ul v-else-if="..condition..">
<li>Goal</li>
</ul>
<p v-else>...</p>
```

## v-else only works on child elements

**This is not gonna work** because `v-else` is not directly comes after the `v-if` element (it is not a child of).

```html
<p v-if="goals.length === 0">...</p>
<p></p>
<ul v-else>
<li>Goal</li>
</ul>
```
