summary: Attaching volumes to the container

## Bind fs
Substitutes a container file with a host file. WARNING: **in lines with *--mount*, there is no space after "," !**. *readonly* option is nice.
Works on single files only. [ref](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)

```bash
docker rm -f diaweb
CONF_SRC=~/example.conf; \
CONF_DST=/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf; \

LOG_SRC=~/example.log; \
LOG_DST=/var/log/nginx/custom.host.access.log; \

docker run -d --name diaweb \
--mount type=bind,src=${CONF_SRC},dst=${CONF_DST},readonly=true \
--mount type=bind,src=${LOG_SRC},dst=${LOG_DST} \
-p 80:80 \
nginx:latest
```
## tmpfs
In memory storage. Never stored statically in the container. (mostly sensitive data). Permission is octal.
```bash
docker run --rm \
--mount type=tmpfs,dst=/tmp,tmpfs-size=16k,tmpfs-mode=1770 \
--entrypoint mount \
alpine:latest -v
```
## Volumes
Same as bind mount but with directories. “I need a place to put some data that I’m working with.” Docker auto remove unused files. Share data between containers by using volumes
```bash
docker volume create \
--driver local \
--label example=cassandra \ #--label key=value
cass-shared
```

```bash
docker run -d \
--volume cass-shared:/var/lib/cassandra/data \ #path in the container
--name cass1 \
cassandra:2.2
```

```bash
docker volume list
docker volume create
docker volume remove
docker inspect volumeName
docker volume prune --filter example=cassandra  #removes volumes via interactive confirmation (--force to supress)
```

Reuse an already existing volume in another container `--volumes-from imageName` (takes all volume). Mount points cannot be changed. Race condition.

```bash
docker run --name fowler \
--mount type=volume,dst=/library/PoEAA \
--mount type=bind,src=/tmp,dst=/library/DSL \
alpine:latest \
echo "Fowler collection created."

docker run --name knuth \
--mount type=volume,dst=/library/TAoCP.vol1 \
--mount type=volume,dst=/library/TAoCP.vol2 \
--mount type=volume,dst=/library/TAoCP.vol3 \
--mount type=volume,dst=/library/TAoCP.vol4.a \
alpine:latest \
echo "Knuth collection created"

docker run --name reader \
--volumes-from fowler \
--volumes-from knuth \
alpine:latest ls -l /library/
```

* Mount points allow many file systems from many devices to be attached to a single file tree. Every container has its own file tree.
* Containers can use bind mounts to attach parts of the host file system into a container.
* In-memory file systems can be attached to a container file tree so that sensitive or temporary data is not written to disk.
* Docker provides anonymous or named storage references called volumes.
* Volumes can be created, listed, and deleted using the appropriate docker volume subcommand.
* Volumes are parts of the host file system that Docker mounts into containers at specified locations.
* Volumes have life cycles of their own and might need to be periodically cleaned up.
* Docker can provide volumes backed by network storage or other more sophisticated tools if the appropriate volume plugin is installed.
