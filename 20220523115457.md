summary: Difference between *NAT* and *Bridge Adapter* mode

**NAT mode**
* The host computer hosting the virtual machine, so the host computer acts as the router

    
               Network

            Host Computer
                  |
           Virtual Machine
   
**Bridge Adapter Mode**
* The Virtual machine is treated like the client on the network


                     Network

       Host Computer          Virtual Machine
