## Virtual Machine Network NAT vs Bridge adapter

**NAT mode**
* The host computer hosting the virtual machine, so the host computer acts as the router

    
               Network         
                  |
            Host Computer
                  |
           Virtual Machine
   
**Bridge Adapter Mode**
* The Virtual machine is treated like the client on the network


                     Network                   
                        |
           ---------------------------
           |                         |
       Host Computer          Virtual Machine

(Both client treated on the same level)
