summary: Iterate objects
---
`v-for` appends the result on every iteration. That means it will never render the whole results on every iteration. So lets assume the 5th iteration in this case:

```html
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>  <!-- this is added only on 5th iteration -->
```
Every time the array size changes, it will be re-rendered. Vue tries to re-use existing DOM elements (Vue can see the elements as DOM element, it does not know whether they are unique or all the same), just "copy up" an element if we delete something from the list. Sometime this can introduce bugs. [More (udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/21463290#overview).

To resolve this problem, Vue introduces a non-html element: `v-bind:key=""` which is optional but should be used with the `v-for`. `key` is unique identifier which resolves this "bug".


## General Syntax

```vue
<li v-for="g in goals">{{g}}</li>
```

## Getting the index as well

```vue
<li v-for="(g, index) in goals">{{index}}. {{g}}</li>
```

## Object iterations also possible

Some times we need to iterate over an object (and it's properties):

```vue
<li v-for="value in {'name' : adam, 'age' : 100}">{{value}}</li>
```

The output will be:

```html
<li>adam</li>
<li>100</li>
```
Getting the object key:

```vue
<li v-for="(key, value)in {'name' : adam, 'age' : 100}">{{key}} - {{value}}</li>
```

## Looping through a range of numbers

```vue
<li v-for="num in 100">{{num}}</li>
```

## Click event anomaly - Propagation escalation

Lets assume we have a click event on the list-for items:

```vue
<li v-for="(g, index) in goals" @click="removeGoal(index)">
    {{g}}
    <button type="text" @click.stop></button>
</li>
```

Without the `@click.stop` if we click on the button, the `removeGoal()` function would run (which removes the list item). The `@click.stop` will stop the propagation so clicking on the button will not remove the whole list item. However, we have to use `@click.stop` **in the form tag** if we work with a "plain top level" form.
