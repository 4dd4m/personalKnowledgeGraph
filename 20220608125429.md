summary: Setup a simple router
---
First lets install a 3rd party package:

```bash
npm install --save vue-router
```

And then import this app in the main js file:


```vue
//main.js
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router';
import App from './App.vue';

import TeamsList from './components/teams/TeamsList.vue';
import UsersList from './components/users/UsersList.vue';

const router = createRouter({
    history:  createWebHistory(),
    routes: [
        {path: '/teams', component: TeamsList},
        {path: '/users', component: UsersList},
    ],
});

const app = createApp(App)
app.use(router);

app.mount('#app');
```

After we imported the `createRouter` module, we create a router object:
* in a `routes` array we defined on what component should load on each path
* `app.use()` will inject the custom plugin into the app (any 3rd party plugin should be loaded this way)
* the `createWebHistory` is part of the vue-router. It is for QoS

The next thing is insert the `router-view` tag. This tells to Vue to handle the urls here.

```vue
//App.vue
<template>
  <the-navigation></the-navigation>
  <main>
    <router-view></router-view>
  </main>
</template>
```

## Linking another page

The components receives a `router-link` tag (provided by the vue-router). This tag behind the scenes renders an anchor tag. We can put any html code inside of the tag, because it is using slots. The `to=""` attribute will tell the Vue where to go, but this definition should exist in the router definition:

```vue
//inside of a component
<template>
    <header>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><router-link to="/teams">Teams</router-link></li>
                <li><router-link to="/users">Users</router-link></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
</template>
```

But sometimes we want to navigate with some buttons, and the rendered `a` tag is not suitable for that. But it is not impossible:

```vue
<template>
    <button @click="confirmInput()">Go to teams</button>
    <ul>
        <user-item v-for="user in users" :key="user.id" :name="user.fullName" :role="user.role"></user-item>
    </ul>
</template>

<script>
import UserItem from './UserItem.vue';

export default {
    components: {
        UserItem,
    },
    inject: ['users'],
    methods:{
        confirmInput(){
            this.$router.push('/teams');
            //this.$router.back();
            //this.$router.forward();
        }
    }
};
</script>
```

This is just the old way, using a click-method bind. The `$router` is in the vue-router package, has some fundamental methods, int he example above the `push` function will send the browser to that address. Compared to the `router-link` `$router` has a total freedom about the url, it can redirect anywhere. 


## Dynamic Route Parameter

We can assign dynamic parameters to the url (without a type). The passed parameter will be available to the component:

```vue
const router = createRouter({
    history:  createWebHistory(),
    routes: [
        {path: '/teams', component: TeamsList},
        {path: '/users', component: UsersList},
        {path: '/users/:teamId', component: TeamMembers},
    ],
});
```

## Parameters, redirect, alias

The parsing will go from top to bottom. And will stop on the last match, so the order of the paths are matters. Router never pass properties to the components until we order it (`props: true`).

```vue
const router = createRouter({
    history:  createWebHistory(),
    routes: [
        //{path: '/', redirect : '/teams'},
        {path: '/', component: TeamsList, alias : '/'},
        {path: '/teams', component: TeamsList},
        {path: '/users', component: UsersList, props: true},
        {path: '/teams/:teamId', component: TeamMembers},
        {path: '/:notFound(.*)', component: NotFound},
    ],
});
```

Redirect can happen two ways:
* Redirect: the url will change
* Alias: the url will not change

The `notFound` is a special paramter (the name can be anything), followed by a regExp match. Every url, that is matching the regexp expression, will be mapped out to the `NotFound` component.
