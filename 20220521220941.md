# Docker - ONBUILD


The ONBUILD instruction defines other instructions to execute if the resulting image is used as a base for another build. For example:

```bash
ONBUILD COPY [".", "/var/myapp"]
ONBUILD RUN go build /var/myapp
```

The ONBUILD commands will run at image building, after the first FROM command. Nice way te auto. resolve some dependency.
