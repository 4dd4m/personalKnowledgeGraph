# Docker Users


The root user has almost full privileged access to the state of the container. Any processes running as th at user inherit those permissions. It fol- lows that if thereâ€™s a bug in one of thos e processes, it might damage the container.  There are ways to limit the damage, but the most effective way to prevent these types of issues is not to use the root user.

The image default user is root:
```bash
docker container run --rm --entrypoint "" busybox:1.29 whoami
```
Running a simple `whoami` to determine the default user (entrypoint which is the images "stratup script" is set no none, to avoid some possible user switching)

```bash
docker container run --rm \
--user nobody \                     #set container's run-as user
busybox:1.29 id
```

By default, the Docker daemon API is accessible via a UNIX domain socket located on the host at /var/run/ docker.sock. The domain socket is protected with filesystem permissions ensuring that only the root user and members of the docker group may send commands or retrieve data from the Docker daemon.
