summary: Create a network between the containers
---
```bash
docker network ls   #list all network

NETWORK         ID          NAME    DRIVER  SCOPE
63d93214524b    bridge      bridge  local       #bridge: intercontainer connectivity on one machine (not recommended. use own bridge network)
6eeb489baff0    host        host    local       #host: will not create any network (localhost)
3254d02034ed    none        null    local       #only loopback interface available
#local, global (created on every node with no adress), swarm (multi host, cluster wide)
```

That IP address is the one that any other container **on this bridge network** would use to communicate with services you run in this container. The **loopback** interface can be used only for communication **within the same container**.

The overlay network driver is availabl e on Docker engines where swarm mode is enabled. Overlay networks are similar in construction to bridge networks, but the logical bridge component is multihost-aware and can route intercontainer connections between every node in a swarm.

In short, always deploy containers with appropriate application-level access-control mechanisms because containers on the same container network will have mutual (bidirectional) unrestricted network access.
