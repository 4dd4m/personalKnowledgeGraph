Title: Bash - `` vs $()

summary: What is the difference?
---
Both commands start a subshell and evaluates the expression.  The difference is only visual. It is easier to see a nested `$()` syntax, i.e:

```bash
libdir=$(dirname $(dirname $(which gcc)))/lib
```

Compared to this:

```bash
libdir=`dirname \`dirname \\`which gcc\\`\``/lib
```

Backtick are use in the legacy Bourne Shell.
